Description: Carries out analyses of two-way tables with one observation per cell, together with graphical displays
    for an additive fit and
    a diagnostic plot for removable 'non-additivity' via a power transformation of the response.
    It implements Tukey's Exploratory Data Analysis (1973) <ISBN: 978-0201076165> methods, including a
    1-degree-of-freedom test for row*column 'non-additivity', linear in the row and column effects.
