# twoway

The `twoway` package provides analysis and graphical methods for two-way tables with one observation per cell,
most typically used in an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) context.
The methods follow Tukey (1949), "One Degree of Freedom for Non-additivity" and Tukey (1972), *Exploratory Data Analysis*
The R implementation is based on my SAS macro, [twoway.sas](http://www.datavis.ca/sasmac/twoway.html).

## Installation

You can install `twoway` from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("friendly/twoway")
```

## Example

This will eventually be a basic example which shows you how to use the package:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```
