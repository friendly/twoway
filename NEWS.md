# twoway 0.4.1

* Modified the twoway plot method per suggestions of Richard Heiberger (better axis labels)
* `plot.twoway(..., which="diagnose")` gets an `annotate=` argument

# twoway 0.4.0

* Added an initial `anova.twoway()` method
* Update README

# twoway 0.3.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Added a `as.data.frame` method for `twoway` objects. This similifies graphical displays and other computations.
* `print.twoway()` gets a `border=2` option to print the result in a fancy table with horizontal and vertical separators [thx: Richard Heiberger]
